# Operator Overloading

**Version:** 0.2.0  
**Date:** November 12, 2025  
**Status:** Syntax Ready (Codegen Pending)

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Contract-based**: Operators MUST be declared in a contract first.
2. **`op` prefix mandatory**: All operator methods use `op+`, `op-`, `op*`, etc.
3. **Multiple overloads**: One contract can define multiple operator overloads with different parameter types.
4. **Explicit implementation**: No automatic derivation — the implementing type explicitly defines its operator methods.

---

## 📋 Overview

Operator overloading in Vex is implemented as a capability provided through contracts. Contracts declare `op` methods and implementing types (typically `struct`s) provide concrete methods to support operator syntax.

The operator names follow the form `op<token>`, for example `op+`, `op-`, `op==`, as method names in contract declarations and implementations.

The compiler resolves an operator expression `a + b` by:

1. Checking whether `a`'s type implements the contract that defines `op+`.
2. Looking up the overload that best matches the right-hand side argument (`b`), including builtin primitive rules and `Self` substitutions.
3. Compiling a direct call to the corresponding method (`a.op+(b)`).

## Syntax: Contract Declarations

```vex
contract $Add {
    op+(rhs: Self): Self;                    // Same type add
    op+(rhs: i32): Self;                     // Overload with i32
    op+(rhs: f64): Self;                     // Overload with f64
}
```

Rules:

- Contract name describes the capability (`Add`, `Mul`, `Eq`).
- All operator methods must use `op` prefix.
- Overloads are allowed as distinct method signatures.
- Return type is explicit and independent per overload.

---

## Syntax: Implementation

Vex supports both **Inline** and **External** implementation.

### Inline Implementation (Implicit Self)
When defined inside the struct, `self` is implicit.

```vex
struct Vec2 impl Add {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,

    // Inline: 'self' is implicit
    fn op+(other: Vec2): Vec2 {
        return Vec2 { x: self.x + other.x, y: self.y + other.y };
    }
}
```

### External Implementation (Explicit Self)
Use this for cleaner separation of data and behavior.

```vex
fn (self: Vec2) op+(other: Vec2): Vec2 {
    return Vec2 { x: self.x + other.x, y: self.y + other.y };
}
```

Rules:

- Struct must declare `impl ContractName`.
- Inline methods have implicit `self`.
- External methods use receiver syntax `(self: Type)`.

---

## Resolution & Semantics

- Operator expression `a + b` resolves to `a.op+(b)` if `a`'s type implements the contract with a matching signature.
- Matching uses compile-time types; no implicit conversions except for the builtin `extends` contract mapping for primitives.
- If no match is found on the left-hand type, the compiler attempts to check for `coerce` rules and builtin operators (primitives), and finally raises an error.

---

## Overloadable Operators

The following operators can be overloaded by defining the corresponding method on the type.

### Arithmetic
- `+` : `fn op+(self: &Self, other: Other): Result`
- `-` : `fn op-(self: &Self, other: Other): Result`
- `*` : `fn op*(self: &Self, other: Other): Result`
- `/` : `fn op/(self: &Self, other: Other): Result`
- `%` : `fn op%(self: &Self, other: Other): Result`

### Comparison
- `==` : `fn op==(self: &Self, other: Other): bool`
- `!=` : `fn op!=(self: &Self, other: Other): bool`
- `<` : `fn op<(self: &Self, other: Other): bool`
- `<=` : `fn op<=(self: &Self, other: Other): bool`
- `>` : `fn op>(self: &Self, other: Other): bool`
- `>=` : `fn op>=(self: &Self, other: Other): bool`

### Bitwise
- `&` : `fn op&(self: &Self, other: Other): Result`
- `|` : `fn op|(self: &Self, other: Other): Result`
- `^` : `fn op^(self: &Self, other: Other): Result`
- `~` : `fn op~(self: &Self): Result` (Unary NOT)
- `<<` : `fn op<<(self: &Self, shift: u32): Result`
- `>>` : `fn op>>(self: &Self, shift: u32): Result`
- `<<<` : `fn op<<<(self: &Self, shift: u32): Result` (Rotate Left)
- `>>>` : `fn op>>>(self: &Self, shift: u32): Result` (Rotate Right)

### Increment/Decrement
- `++` : `fn op++(self: &Self!)` (Postfix)
- `--` : `fn op--(self: &Self!)` (Postfix)

### Indexing
- `[]` : `fn op[](self: &Self, index: Index): &Output`
- `[]=` : `fn op[]=(self: &Self!, index: Index, value: Value)`
- `[..]` : `fn op[..](self: &Self, range: Range): &Output`
- `[..]=` : `fn op[..]=(self: &Self!, range: Range, value: Value)`

### Special
- `?` : `fn op?(self: &Self): bool` (Truthiness check)
- `!` : `fn op!(self: &Self): Result` (Logical qualifiers)

## Mutability & Side Effects

- Operators that are mutation semantics (like `op+=`) should be defined to mutate `self` with signature including `!` where the contract or implementation requires a mutable receiver.
- The `!` syntax in method signatures indicates the method requires a mutable reference for `self`.

---

## Builtin Primitives & `extends`

- The standard library declares `extends` for primitive types and builtin contracts to provide default operator support. These are specified in `stdlib/core/builtin_contracts.vx` and related files.
- `extends` indicates a special compiler-provided mapping for primitives and is not the same as a user `impl` for user-defined types.

---

## Auto-Generation & Default Implementations

- The compiler may auto-generate comparisons (`op!=` from `op==`) when semantically correct.
- Default contract methods that have body can be used to offer generic operator compositions (e.g., `op!=` defaulting to `!op==`).

---

## Diagnostics & Errors

- Type mismatch in operator operands or return type mismatches result in compile errors.
- When multiple overloads are applicable, the compiler uses exact type match precedence, then consider generic matches and coercions.

---

## Examples

See `examples/` for several samples and tests:

- `examples/test_operator_overloading.vx`
- `examples/test_operator_unary_neg.vx`
- `examples/operator/05_all_operators.vx`
- `examples/PROPOSAL_operator_syntax.vx`

---

## Implementation Notes (Compiler)

- Parser: Operator method names are parsed as `op` token followed by punctuation (e.g., `+`, `-`, `==`).
- Resolution: Compiler looks up `impl` for contract, ensuring correct arity and parameter types.
- Codegen: For user-defined types, the compiler emits calls to the method implementation; for primitives, it emits optimized IR.

---

## Security & Safety Considerations

- Overloading assignment operators like `op=` is either forbidden or strongly discouraged due to move/copy semantics that can easily introduce surprising behavior.
- Implementations must be careful around mutability to avoid aliasing and data races in concurrent code.

---

## Future Work / Open Questions

- Cross-type operator inference rules and conversions.
- Automatic generation of `op!=` vs `op==` symmetries for compound or complex types.
- Partial ordering inference for `Ord`.
